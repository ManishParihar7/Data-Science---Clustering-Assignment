# Clustering Analysis on Crime Data and Airlines Data

This repository contains Python code for performing clustering analysis on two datasets: crime data and airlines data.

## Problem Statement

### Problem Statement 1
Perform clustering (Hierarchical, K-means, and DBSCAN) on crime data to identify the number of clusters formed and draw inferences.

### Problem Statement 2
Perform clustering (Hierarchical, K-means, and DBSCAN) on airlines data to obtain the optimum number of clusters and draw inferences.

## Datasets

- **Crime Data**: The dataset includes information on murder rates, assault rates, urban population, and rape rates in different places in the United States.

- **Airlines Data**: The dataset includes information about airline passengers' behavior.

## Clustering Methods Used

- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Hierarchical clustering was used with different linkage methods and different numbers of clusters.

- **K-Means Clustering**: K-Means clustering was used with various numbers of clusters to find the optimal number.

- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: DBSCAN was applied to the datasets with different parameters to discover clusters.

## How to Use the Code

The Python code for clustering and analysis is available in this repository. You can run the code to perform clustering on the datasets provided. Here's how to do it:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib) installed.
3. Run the Python scripts for clustering analysis.

## File Structure

- `crime_data.csv`: The crime dataset used for clustering in Problem Statement 1.
- `EastWestAirlines.xlsx`: The airlines dataset used for clustering in Problem Statement 2.
- `Clustering_Assignment.ipynb' : The python code for both Airlines and Crime datasets.

## Results

The clustering analysis results and inferences can be found in the respective Jupyter Notebook for each problem statement.
